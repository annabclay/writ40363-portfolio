            <p>I'm originally from Kentucky and grew up on a horse farm. I have had a social media internship working for a boutique in Kentucky, but I have also had experience other places. This summer I had a PR internship in Washington D.C. where I worked with healthcare and politics. Last semester I studied abroad in Rome where I found my love for traveling. I love to hang out with my friends, work out, travel, watch movies, and go out to eat.</p>

    <header2>Current Learning</header2>
            <p>I’m interested in learning more about coding through this class. I have taken a few coding classes before, but I am excited to learn how to create websites. My goal is to leave with a basic understanding of both frontend and backend development that I can build on in the future.</p>
