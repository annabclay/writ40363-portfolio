# My HW3 Reflection

start here from instructions in prompt

# Confidence Check: How confident do you feel about HTML after two weeks in WRIT40363? What specific skills feel solid, and what still feels challenging?

I feel like working on the website in class and you giving feedback during class is very helpful. I feel like I am in a good place right now with following the instructions on D2L. What feels challenging to me is also using GIT Hub while typing on Vusual Studio Code. I might need a little more work on that, but otherwise I feel like the skills that are solid to me is navagating the Vusual Studio code website.

# Learning Curve: Describe your experience learning Git and GitHub. What surprised you about version control? What part was more/less difficult than expected?

I am still a little confused on why we put them in both programs. I might need a little more help on why we are using it/how to use it. I was following along when we pressed commit and downloaded the application, but other than that I am confused.


# Problem-Solving Growth: When you encountered problems this week (code not working, Git confusion, etc.), how did you approach solving them? How has this changed since Week 1?

When I have experienced a problem I have asked a friend in the class and asked for help during class. Since the first week I have realized this class moves at a fast pace and I need to be on top of my work and ask questions in order for me to keep up. With code not working I have tried to fix the mistake and then asked for help.

# Professional Mindset: How do you feel about the transition from "just making web pages" to "developing professionally with semantic HTML and version control"? What excites or concerns you?

I am excited to potentially use these skills in the future to code a website outside of class. I feel like this is one of the first coding classes that resinates with me. When I was younger I made my own website for my friendship bracelets. I understand that we are not "just making web pages" and am looking foward to learning more skills to develop professionally. 

# Week 2 Reflection: What's your biggest "aha moment" or breakthrough from this week? What concept finally "clicked" for you?

One of my biggest breakthrough moments from this week was turning in all of the zip files. Hopefully I turn in this correctly this time, but I now understand how to create zip files for the whole folder instead of just one file.

# Looking Forward: Based on your experience so far, what aspect of web development are you most curious about or nervous about learning next?

I am curious about how we are going to make this website live and use it for potential job employers. I am nervous about learning how to make the code more complex and not just simple.

# Support and Resources: What's been most helpful for your learning so far (class discussions, hands-on practice, online resources, classmates)? What additional support might you need moving forward?

I think what has been the mos thelpful for my learning is doing most of the work step by step in class and then having detailed instructions for the homework. Having every step and instruction extermely detailed is helpful to understand exactly what to do.
